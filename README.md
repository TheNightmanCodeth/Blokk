# Blokk

A jailbreak app that brings back the ability to block alphanumeric senders (ie. email addresses).

# Installing [![Codemagic build status](https://api.codemagic.io/apps/6213da6dff12ccf6a45b90ae/6213da6dff12ccf6a45b90ad/status_badge.svg)](https://codemagic.io/apps/6213da6dff12ccf6a45b90ae/6213da6dff12ccf6a45b90ad/latest_build)

Download the `.deb` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/TheNightmanCodeth/Blokk/releases/latest) and install with `Filza` or your package manager of choice.

Keep in mind you **will need to reboot after adding to the blocklist**. An LDRestart *should* suffice but it hasn't been tested.
